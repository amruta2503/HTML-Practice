            <h2>"About Me"</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, i am <strong>Harry Potter</strong> and i am <small>10</small> year old.
                i live in london at privet drive with my uncle <strong>vernon</strong> and aunt <strong>petunia</strong> and my cousin <Strong>dudley</Strong>.
                my parents died in a car crash when i was a baby. 
            </p>
            <p>
                suddenly before my birthday i received a letter and immediately my uncle snatched it from me 
                and didnt let me read it.
                Even after that the same letter came everyday and in an insane ammount but still my uncle and aunt didnt 
                allow me to read it and to avoid receving we went to a abandoned place.

                it was raining heavily and suddenly a giat entered through the door and wished me happy birthday.
                and i didnt know him and he then gave me that letter which i wanted and there was my invitation of the <mark>hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardary</mark>
                but i said that i am not a wizard but he said you are your parents were the finest the wizards of the hogwarts
                but i said they dies in a car crash and he said no they did not die in a car crash.

                And that how when i turned i got to know that I am a wizar and my parents did not die in a car crash but i was lied about it by my uncle and aunt
            </p>
